	 * from a NULL value (which fails with "cannot cast type integer to
	 * integer[]" on some driver versions).
	 *
	 * Conventions:
	 *   :accessibleSiteIdsActive — boolean ; false ⇒ no filter
	 *   :accessibleSiteIds      — list ; only consulted when active is true.
	 *                              When active=false we pass [-1] as a safe
	 *                              placeholder that will never match any row
	 *                              but keeps the IN(...) clause syntactically
	 *                              valid for the JDBC driver.
